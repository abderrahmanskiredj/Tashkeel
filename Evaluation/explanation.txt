In this analysis, we explore the effectiveness of our Tashkeel technique by conducting evaluations on two distinct datasets: the Fadel dataset and the Abbad dataset. For each dataset, we previously trained our Tashkeel model on the respective training partition. Following this, we assess the model's performance, focusing on its ability to process test sentences of varying lengths. Short test sentences are evaluated directly, while long test sentences are addressed through two strategies: splitting them into shorter segments (utilizing the "test_long_splitted" dataset prepared in the "Preprocess Test Data" module), or applying a sliding window technique to manage their length dynamically.
