# Unlocking the Power of Transfer Learning: A Token Classification Approach to Arabic Text Diacritization

In this repository, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the methodology outlined in the referenced article, utilizing two widely recognized benchmarks: the Fadel dataset and the Abbad dataset. Within the "Test Benchmarks" directory, we provide the test sets for both benchmarks in .txt format for easy access and use.

The "Preprocess Test Data" directory is dedicated to the initial processing of these test sets, transforming them into a structured format suitable for token classification. This involves the creation of "tokens" along with their corresponding "labels," enabling a more structured and analysis-ready dataset.

Finally, in the "Evaluation" directory, we undertake a detailed assessment of our Tashkeel models against the benchmarks. This structured approach ensures a thorough and methodical evaluation process, allowing for clear insights into the performance and effectiveness of the proposed models on the specified datasets.
