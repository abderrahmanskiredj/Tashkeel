In these 2 notebooks, we prepare both Fadel test and Abbad test data for evaluation. More precisely, we transform each test sentence into a token classification example 'tokens' and corresponding 'labels'. Also, we separate test sentences leading to a sequence of tokens of size less than 512 tokens to those of size greater than 512 tokens. This will help us deal with long sentences separately: either by splitting them into subsentences of acceptable length or by using the sliding methodology in inference.
